# dots
my dotfiles for my Arch Linux installs.

## backgrounds
backgrounds is my collection of background images, complete with a README.md containing previews of each image.

## dwm
dwm is a submodule. When initialized, it pulls in my custom dwm build. Details in dwm's README.md file.

## dwmstatus-rs
a custom statusbar generator intended to eventually replace rsblocks

## programs.sh
programs.sh is a shell script that installs the following programs via pacman:
 - feh
 - neovim
 - picom
 - tmux
 - zathura
     - zathura-pdf-mupdf

## rsblocks
rsblocks is the program used to set the statusbar for dwm; I'm working on writing a custom replacement for it,
but until it's in a decent state rsblocks will do.

## slock
same deal as dwm; submodule, pulls custom build of slock. Details in slock's README.md file.

## st
submodule linking to [Luke Smith](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st)'s build of st, which I currently use.
This one requires a special note: while I appreciate the projects Mr. Smith has chosen to share, I explicitly do
*not* endorse his political beliefs that he so readily shares through his social media accounts.
